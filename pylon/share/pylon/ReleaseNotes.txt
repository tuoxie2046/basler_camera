       the firmware of an CXP-12 Interface Card 1C, if necessary.
* CXP/GenTL: [212138, 211972, 214966] The CXP GenTL Producer, ProducerCXP.cti, has 
             been updated to version 5.9.1.
* CXP/GenTL: [220171] A new buffer overflow handling has been implemented. In the event 
             of buffer overflow, affected images will be reported as failed.   
* CXP: [212992] The GrabberFirmwareUpdater tool has been added. It allows you to update 
       the firmware of CXP-12 Interface Cards and frame grabbers. For more information, 
       refer to the GrabberFirmwareUpdater_Readme located in the same folder, e.g., 
       \Runtime\x64\pylonCXP\bin.
* CXP: [212993] The gpioTool has been added. It allows you to configure the physical 
       properties of the trigger signals received or sent by a Basler interface card
       or a frame grabber. For more information, refer to the gpioTool_Readme located in 
       the same folder, e.g., \Runtime\x64\pylonCXP\bin.
* CXP/GenTL: The firmware version of CXP-12 Interface Cards can now be queried via 
             the GenTL Producer. To do so, use the InterfaceFirmwareVersion parameter.
* CXP/pylon Viewer: The pylon Viewer doesn't require a restart after changing an 
                    applet anymore. The name of the applet currently loaded is 
                    displayed correctly now.
* GigE Vision: The GEV socket driver has been updated. It supports better resend 
               mechanisms comparable to the GEV performance driver now.    
* GigE Vision: [197963] Firewall traversal has been added to bypass the Windows firewall 
               for GVSP packets. 
* GigE Vision: [197829] No GVCP packet resend commands will be sent by pylon when 
               the GVCP Capability register is not set on the device. 
* USB: [211260] Added the DeviceVersion parameter to the DeviceInfo parameters for USB cameras.
* SDK: [220227] New parameters for Basler boost dual-channel CoaXPress cameras, CXP-12 
       Interface Cards 1C/2C/4C, and imaWorx CXP-12 Quad frame grabbers have been added to 
       the CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera class.
* PylonC: [197658] The Chunk.c SDK sample has been adapted to better demonstrate the 
          use of camera chunk data with ace 2 cameras. 
* pylon Viewer: [215258] In the Tools menu, the CXP Tools option has been added. It 
                provides direct access to the GrabberFirmwareUpdater and the gpioTool tools 
                if CXP has been installed.
* pylon Viewer: [195378] The New Features tab in the Welcome to pylon dialog has been updated 
                with information about Basler blaze 3D cameras.
* pylon Viewer: [218627] The Show Tree View option has been added to the Features-All pane. 
                When selected, the device features will be displayed in tree instead of flat view. 
* pylon Viewer: [207931] The pylon GUI tools, e.g., pylon Viewer, pylon IP Configurator, etc., 
                have been built on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.


DISCONTINUATION NOTICE
=========================
* Basler dart BCON for LVDS cameras are no longer supported. Use previous versions of 
  pylon if support for dart BCON for LVDS is required.


CORRECTIONS
===========
* GigE Vision: [203028] Fixed a potential issue where a device removal may not have 
               been detected when disabling the network adapter the camera is connected to.
* pylon: [200514] Fixed an issue where an empty chunk caused an exception on USB cameras.
* pylon: [211670] Installer rollbacks in case of minor problems during installation are now prevented.
* GenTL: [205061] Fixed an issue in the ProducerGEV.cti where changes to the SocketBufferSize 
         node had no effect.
* GenTL: [212719] A correct value for BUFFER_INFO_DELIVERED_CHUNKPAYLOADSIZE (U3V/GigE) 
         and _CHUNKLAYOUT (U3V only) is set now.
* GenTL: [218622] The ProducerU3V.cti correctly returns NAMESPACE_PFNC_32BIT instead of 
         UNKNOWN now.
* GenTL: [220347] The setup-env.sh script now sets the GenICam GenTL path on a Debian Buster
         distribution correctly.  
* SDK: [201343] Fixed an issue where CGrabResultData::GetImageSize() would return wrong value 
       for the YCbCr420_8_YY_CbCr_Semiplanar pixel format. 
* SDK: [201060] Fixed an issue in Callback.h that may have caused a compiler error when using a 
       GCC 11 compiler.
* SDK: [203519] Fixed an issue with CPixelTypeMapper when using the YUV422_8_UYVY pixel format. 
* PylonC: [212325] The C Programmer’s Guide has been expanded to reflect the use of the 
          PylonStreamGrabberStartStreamingIfMandatory() function, which is mandatory for 
          image acquisition with CXP cameras.
* pylon Viewer: [208844] The pylon Viewer will now return an error when an invalid parameter is set 
                in the Features-All pane. 
* pylon Viewer: [209520] Fixed an issue where an assertion has been reported while using the 
                Data32f pixel format in combination with the Histogram feature.
* pylon Viewer: [201977, 192246] Improved multiple issues related to the product improvement 
                program.


RESTRICTIONS
============
* CXP: Using secure boot (UEFI mode) with Linux requires a driver that is signed with a trusted 
       certificate. Since the driver is provided as source code, there is no way to sign it 
       with a trusted Basler certificate. To work with the driver, secure boot can be disabled. 
       Alternatively, the driver can be self-signed as described in this [Ubuntu blog entry]
       https://ubuntu.com/blog/how-to-sign-things-for-secure-boot).
* CXP: When camera parameters are changed during image acquisition, the change is 
       not reflected in the interface card. 
* CXP: If images are lost on the interface card due to a buffer overflow, e.g., when 
       the user application doesn't (re)queue buffers fast enough to deliver the images,
       this will be indicated by the next delivered buffer. This will be marked as INCOMPLETE, 
       its fill size will be 0, and the custom error code BUFFER_INFO_BASLER_XAPI_ERROR_CODE 
       is set to 42. Additionally, one lost frame will be added to the stream info. Note that  
       exactly one lost frame will be added regardless of how many frames were lost due to 
       the overflow.
* CXP: The GenTL device ID changes when an applet is changed. Therefore, the device ID that 
       was queried with one applet can be used with a different board and a different applet 
       only if the applet has the same name as the original one with which the device ID 
       was generated. 
* CXP: The GenTL BUFFER_INFO_FRAME_ID, which can be queried via DSGetBufferInfo, doesn't 
       contain the source tag from the CXP image header. Instead, it contains a counter for 
       all frames that have been delivered to the computer.
* CXP: During an applet change, the cameras attached to an interface card are still displayed 
       in the devices list, even though they are not accessible anymore. An attempt to open a 
       camera in this state leads to an error message.
* CXP: When the DeviceUserID of a camera is changed, a restart of the GenTL Producer is 
       required for the change to be reflected via the GenTL API. When using a GUI to interact 
       with the camera via GenTL (i.e., the pylon Viewer), a restart of that application is 
       required for the change to become visible.
* CXP: Under rare circumstances, when the CXP link speed is changed frequently on one port, at 
       some point a speed change has no effect anymore. To work around that, 
       either reload the applet by loading a different applet and then loading the original 
       one again, or set the value of the environment variable SISO_FORCE_RELOAD_APPLET to 'yes'.
* CXP: In rare cases, the camera is not found after booting the computer. Power-cycle
       the camera to resolve this.
* CXP: Grabbing with very high frame rates above 50000 fps using the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card 1C is not supported.
* CXP: When allocating buffers used for grabbing, the buffer address must be
       aligned to 8-byte increments. This is automatically the case if you use
       heap memory.
* CXP: If a version of the Silicon Software Runtime is installed on your computer,
       you may experience incompatibility issues when using CoaXPress cameras
       and interface cards. Therefore, Basler advises against installing pylon
       in parallel to the Silicon Software Runtime.
* 3D: To use Basler blaze 3D cameras requires the pylon Supplementary Package
      for blaze to be installed. The pylon Supplementary Package for blaze will be
      available for download on the Basler website at a later stage.
* SDK: Some ace 2 cameras may use a boolean parameter instead of the usual enumeration
       for event notifications. The following code snippets can be used to work around
       this issue.
       For C++ you can use:
         CBooleanParameter(camera.GetNodeMap(), "EventNotification").TrySetValue(true);
       in addition to:
         camera.EventNotification.TrySetValue(EventNotification_On);
* pylon C: The pylon C API doesn't provide convenient functions to use GenDC
           and the Basler blaze 3D camera yet.
* pylon C: For using the GenTL Consumer (e.g., with CoaXPress), additional functionality
           was added to pylon C to be able to start and stop streaming explicitly. This
           functionality has not been documented in the pylon C programmer's guides yet.
           Please refer to the pylon C++ programmer's guide (see chapter "Migrating
           from Previous Versions - Changes in the IStreamGrabber API") or the
           pylonC OverlappedGrab programming sample.
* pylon Viewer: To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
                your system. On Debian-based platforms, you will also need to install the
                libgl1-mesa-dri and libgl1-mesa-glx packages.
* GenTL: [133711] Limited GenTL support for producers with GenTL version 1.4
         and below.
* MP4: MP4 video recording requires the pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 to
       be installed in order to work. The pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4
       is available for download on the Basler website.
* MP4: Recording of video files with cameras with 20 MPixel or higher resolution
       may fail if the Quality parameter is set to 80 % or more. To work around that,
       set the Quality parameter to a lower value.
* MP4: [139274] The Recording feature doesn't support the Compression Beyond
       feature in ace 2 Pro cameras. When recording is started and the Compression
       Beyond feature is enabled, pylon will first disable the Compression Beyond
       feature in the camera and then start recording.
* General: Under certain circumstances, e.g., a very slow or busy computer,
           the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been opened in the
           pylon Viewer.
           To prevent this, close the camera before using the Color Calibrator.
* SDK: Kernel 3.x or higher is required to use the pylon C API.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
               fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
       use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher) or Chrome 49 (or higher).
* GigE Vision: Assigning a static IP address to a camera that is not in the same
               subnet as the network adapter may make the camera unreachable. To prevent this,
               set the rp_filter (reverse path filter) to 2 ("loose mode") on the camera's network
               interface. For more information, see the Assigning an IP Address to a Camera topic
               in the Basler Product Documentation.

DISCONTINUATION NOTICE
=========================
* Linux x86 32 bit is no longer supported. Use previous versions of pylon if 32-bit Linux 
  support is required.


CORRECTIONS
===========
* GenTL: [172316] Fixed an issue in the ProducerU3V.cti and ProducerGEV.cti producers, 
         where EventGetData could return custom error code -10001 instead of
         GC_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL when the buffer passed was too small.
* GenTL: [184792] The access mode of the InterfaceUpdateList has been changed to 
         write-only.
* GigE Vision: [158474] Unicasts and directed broadcasts, of ActionCommands and
               ScheduledActionCommands, are only sent if the request subnet matches the
               subnet of the IP address. This will reduce unexpected delays if a

           combination with a camera emulator.
* pylon Viewer: [187482, 152733] The pylon Viewer works correctly with a remote X-server 
                now. 
* pylon Viewer: [188833] The RPATH for running the pylon Viewer via X-server has been 
                corrected. 
* pylon Viewer: [183914] The histogram calculation is only performed when the histogram 
                pane is active now.

  the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been opened in the
  pylon Viewer.
  To prevent this, close the camera before using the Color Calibrator.
* SDK: Kernel 3.x or higher is required to use the pylon C API.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
               fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.

VERSION:            6.1.3 (armhf, aarch64)

################################################################################

BINARY COMPATIBILITY
=========================
Applications built with pylon 6.1.0 are compatible with pylon 6.1.3.


NEW FEATURES / CHANGES
=========================
* pylon Viewer: Added a command-line switch that allows you to force hardware
  or software rendering. This may be useful in case you notice problems with
  displaying the Welcome dialog, for example.


CORRECTIONS
=========================
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue that may have caused unexpected termination on
  some armhf and aarch64 processors.


RESTRICTIONS
=========================
* pylon Viewer: To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
  your system. On Debian-based platforms, you will also need to install the libgl1-mesa-dri
  and libgl1-mesa-glx packages.
* pylon C: The pylon C API doesn't support the Basler Compression Beyond
        feature yet.
* pylon C: For using the GenTL Consumer (e.g., with CoaXPress),
        additional functionality was added to pylon C to be able
        to start and stop streaming explicitly. This functionality has not been
        documented in the pylon C programmer's guides yet.
        Please refer to the pylon C++ programmer's guide (see chapter "Migrating
        from Previous Versions - Changes in the IStreamGrabber API") or the
        pylonC OverlappedGrab programming sample.
* GenTL: [133711] Limited GenTL support for producers with GenTL version 1.4
         and below.
* CXP: In rare cases, the camera is not found after booting the computer. Power-cycle
       the camera to resolve this.
* CXP: Grabbing with very high frame rates above 50000 fps using the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card 1C is not supported.
* CXP: When allocating buffers used for grabbing, the buffer address must be
       aligned to 8-byte increments. This is automatically the case if you use
       heap memory.
* CXP: If a version of the Silicon Software Runtime is installed on your computer,
       you may experience incompatibility issues when using CoaXPress cameras
       and interface cards. Therefore, Basler advises against installing pylon
       in parallel to Silicon Software Runtime.
* MP4: MP4 video recording requires the pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 to
       be installed in order to work. The pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4
       is available for download on the Basler website.
* MP4: Recording of video files with cameras with 20 MPixel or higher resolution
       may fail if the Quality parameter is set to 80 % or more. To work around that,
       set the Quality parameter to a lower value.
* MP4/AVI: [139274] The Recording feature doesn't support the Compression Beyond
       feature in ace 2 Pro cameras. When recording is started and the Compression
       Beyond feature is enabled, pylon will first disable the Compression Beyond
       feature in the camera and then start recording.
* Under certain circumstances, e.g., a very slow or busy computer,
  the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been opened in the
  pylon Viewer.
  To prevent this, close the camera before using the Color Calibrator.
* SDK: Kernel 3.x or higher is required to use the pylon C API.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.

       The migration mode allows you to easily adapt existing applications
       that were written for GigE cameras based on GenICam SFNC 1.x so
       that they work with GigE cameras based on SFNC 2.x as well, e.g.,
       Basler ace 2 GigE cameras.
* SDK: [116863] Added the concept of interfaces to transport layers. An interface
       is used to represent a frame grabber board, a network card, etc.
       This object type is currently used mainly by the pylon GenTL
       Consumer transport layer. This is currently used for CoaXPress.
* SDK: [139226] Added the Utility_IpConfig sample, which illustrates how to configure the IP
       address of GigE cameras. In addition, this sample can be used to automatically and
       programmatically configure multiple GigE Vision cameras. As the sample accepts command
       line arguments, it can be directly executed, e.g., from a batch script file.
* SDK: [127827] Added the Utility_ImageDecompressor sample, which illustrates how to enable
       the compression feature in Basler ace 2 Pro cameras and how to decompress the images
       using the CImageDecompressor class.
* SDK: [143319] Added the CInstantInterface class to handle interfaces, e.g., the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card.
* SDK: [143319] Added the Utility_InstantInterface SDK sample for working with the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card.
* SDK: [144475] New parameters for Basler ace 2 Pro camera and the Basler SLP Controller have been
       added to the CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera class.
* SDK/USB3: [149732] A new stream grabber statistic parameter called “Statistic_Out_Of_Memory_Error_Count”
            has been added. It provides information about insufficient memory on the host.
* SDK: [136974] Added GetBufferSize() function to GrabResultData and GrabResult to query the
       actual size of the grab result buffer.
* SDK: [136974] Added additional enumeration entries with correct GrabStatus_ prefix to EGrabStatus
       to conform with the naming scheme of enumerations. Old entries can still be used for
       backwards compatibility.
* SDK: [136974] Deprecated old pylon 2.x GrabStatus enumeration type. Please use EGrabStatus instead.
* SDK: [113430] Added TLInfo, InterfaceID, and DeviceID to infos during enumeration
       for pylon C++ and pylonC.
* SDK: [121880] Buffers can be cleared (filled with 0) using the ClearBufferModeEnable
       parameter of the InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [120870] Calling AcquisitionStart and AcquisitionStop in InstantCamera can be enabled
       or disabled using the parameter AcquisitionStartStopExecutionEnable of the
       InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [120589] Extended IStreamGrabber with IsStartAndStopStreamingMandatory(),
       StartStreamingIfMandatory(), and StopStreamingIfMandatory().
       Calling the corresponding methods is mandatory for pylon C when using CoaXPress
       cameras. See the programmer's guides for more details.
* SDK: [131024] Added method to retrieve current payload size from Stream
       Grabber for pylon C.
* SDK: [133422] If the DeviceUserID of the camera is empty, an empty UserDefinedName entry
       will be added to the DeviceInfo object.
* SDK: [132430] Added missing documentation for CTlFactory functions.
* SDK: [153468] Standard C library define-directives are only applied by the pylon/Platform.h header
       file if not already defined previously in a translation unit.
* BPD: [152178] Updated the Basler Product Documentation to version 32.

* GenTL: [143087] Fixed an issue where the USB3 and GigE producers could return
         GC_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER when calling EventGetDataInfo when passing valid data.


RESTRICTIONS
=========================
* pylon Viewer: To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
  your system. On Debian-based platforms, you will also need to install the libgl1-mesa-dri
  and libgl1-mesa-glx packages.
* pylon C: The pylon C API doesn't support the Basler Compression Beyond
        feature yet.
* pylon C: For using the GenTL Consumer (e.g., with CoaXPress),
        additional functionality was added to pylon C to be able
        to start and stop streaming explicitly. This functionality has not been
        documented in the pylon C programmer's guides yet.
        Please refer to the pylon C++ programmer's guide (see chapter "Migrating
        from Previous Versions - Changes in the IStreamGrabber API") or the
        pylonC OverlappedGrab programming sample.
* GenTL: [133711] Limited GenTL support for producers with GenTL version 1.4
         and below.
* CXP: In rare cases, the camera is not found after booting the computer. Power-cycle
       the camera to resolve this.
* CXP: Grabbing with very high frame rates above 50000 fps using the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card 1C is not supported.
* CXP: When allocating buffers used for grabbing, the buffer address must be
       aligned to 8-byte increments. This is automatically the case if you use
       heap memory.
* CXP: If a version of the Silicon Software Runtime is installed on your computer,
       you may experience incompatibility issues when using CoaXPress cameras
       and interface cards. Therefore, Basler advises against installing pylon
       in parallel to Silicon Software Runtime.
* MP4: MP4 video recording requires the pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 to
       be installed in order to work. The pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4
       is available for download on the Basler website.
* MP4: Recording of video files with cameras with 20 MPixel or higher resolution
       may fail if the Quality parameter is set to 80 % or more. To work around that,
       set the Quality parameter to a lower value.
* MP4/AVI: [139274] The Recording feature doesn't support the Compression Beyond
       feature in ace 2 Pro cameras. When recording is started and the Compression
       Beyond feature is enabled, pylon will first disable the Compression Beyond
       feature in the camera and then start recording.
* Under certain circumstances, e.g., a very slow or busy computer,
  the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been opened in the
  pylon Viewer.
  To prevent this, close the camera before using the Color Calibrator.
* SDK: Kernel 3.x or higher is required to use the pylon C API.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
  fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
  use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher), or Chrome 49 (or higher).
* GigE Vision: Assigning a static IP address to a camera that is not in the same
  subnet as the network adapter may make the camera unreachable. To prevent this,
  set the rp_filter (reverse path filter) to 2 ("loose mode") on the camera's network
  interface. For more information, see the Assigning an IP Address to a Camera topic
  in the Basler Product Documentation.

  be removed. pylon will provide a header-only replacement that can be copied to
  the code base of the program using pylon.
* All device-specific camera classes will be replaced by the Universal Instant camera
  class. The header files will stay in place and redirect to the Universal Instant
  camera class.
* All Legacy C++ samples will be removed.
* All device-specific C++ samples will be removed. These samples are replaced by
  the Universal C++ samples.

  environment variables.
* SDK: pylon now supports copy deployment.
* SDK: Deprecated C++ header files have been removed.
* SDK: Names of C/C++ shared objects have changed. Therefore, project settings need to be adjusted.
* SDK: C++ Exceptions are no longer derived from std::exception.
* SDK: PylonInitialize() and PylonTerminate() C++ API functions are now reference counted.
  Each call to PylonInitialize() must be balanced by a call to PylonTerminate().
* SDK: Added support for recent versions of Basler USB 3.0 and GigE cameras.
* SDK: Added support for BayerGR10p, BayerGB10p, BayerRG10p, and BayerBG10p pixel formats.
* SDK: CInstantCamera has been extended by the CanWaitForFrameTriggerReady() method for
  better support of dart and pulse camera models.
* SDK: The C++ sample code has been improved for better support of dart and pulse
  camera models.

* USB3: Support for dart and pulse camera devices has been added.
* pylon Viewer: Added the "Automatic Image Adjustment" feature to automatically make all settings
  necessary to get a good image under current conditions. This feature is available for ace,
  dart and pulse cameras.
* pylon Viewer: Favorites: For faster access to frequently used features,
  features can be placed in the "Favorites" category either by using the context menu or by using drag &
  drop.
* pylon Viewer: Improved the fps display.
* SDK: Added support and samples for the sequencer feature of USB cameras.
* pylon Viewer: Throughput and bandwidth values are now consistently depicted in MB/s
  (1,000,0000 Byte/s) instead of MiB/s (1,048,576  Byte/s).
* pylon Viewer: Added context menus to the entries in the "Devices" pane.
* pylon Viewer: Cameras can be explicitly opened and closed. Please note that a camera is no longer
  opened automatically by a single click. To open a camera, double-click the desired entry in the
  "Devices" group, or select the desired entry and open the camera via the context menu or toolbar
  button.
* pylon Viewer: Added a message log window informing the user about notes, warnings, and errors.
* pylon Viewer: By default, the viewer now displays incompletely grabbed or corrupted frames. The
  number of successfully grabbed and corrupted frames is shown in the status bar of the image windows.
* USB3: Added error message texts to the statistics parameters provided by the pylon USB Transport Layer
  and Stream Grabber objects.
* GigE Vision: The Stream Grabber's statistic data remains readable after the grabbing has stopped.
* SDK: "Legacy" samples have been added illustrating how to add USB 3.0 support to applications still
  using the pylon low-level API.
* SDK: Added a feature called "migration mode" to simplify the transition of existing applications
  to USB 3.0.
* SDK: Added documentation and sample that illustrate the Buffer Factory. The Buffer Factory enables
  the Instant Camera classes to use memory provided by the application.
* GigE Vision: Added support for action commands and scheduled action commands allowing to trigger multiple cameras simultaneously.
* USB3: Added/improved samples demonstrating event handling.
* IP Configurator: Added facilities for providing user feedback and contacting Basler support by email.
* Documentation: Updated migration guide.

* SDK: No environment variables are required anymore to run pylon.


CORRECTIONS
===========

* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue where the pylon Viewer could crash when closing a camera.
* IP Configurator: Fixed message text in Contact Support dialog.
* USB3: Fixed an issue where accessing camera parameters could introduce lag to image streaming.
* GigE: Fixed an issue that caused the enumeration of the cameras to fail when using a very large
  number of network adapters.
* SDK: Fixed missing entry for Mono10p pixel type in Pylon::CPixelTypeMapper class. Mono10p can
  now be displayed by the pylon Viewer.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed a problem that caused the pylon Viewer to generate additional
  CPU load in idle state.
* SDK: The SoftwareTrigger Configuration class did not work correctly with linescan cameras.
* GigE: The device enumeration mechanism may have missed cameras if a certain number of connected
  cameras was exceeded.
* USB3: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when IDeviceFactory::IsDeviceAccessible for USB 3.0 cameras
  was called.
* SDK: ITransportLayer::ReleaseTl() did not always free the resources allocated by a transport layer.
  This fix may affect applications accidentally calling ReleaseTl() too often. Ensure
  that for every call of CTlFactory::CreateTl() there is only one ReleaseTl() call.
* SDK: Fixed thread-safety issues with the CTlFactory class.
* pylon Viewer: No camera features were shown if a device could only be opened at second attempt.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed problems occurring when enabling the Line Pitch camera feature.
* pylon Viewer: The "Copy Camera Features" menu entry only became available after the first image had
  been grabbed.
* USB3: Exception may have been thrown when closing the camera.
* USB3: Fixed problems occurring when enabling the Line Pitch camera feature.
* USB3: Statistics: Incomplete frames were counted as 'missed frames'.
* GigE: Fixed resource leak that occurred when using action commands.
